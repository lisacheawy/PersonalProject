# 1. Boat Race Game
### Introduction
Our first shared project is a Boat Race game and was initially intended for a university assignment. However, we decided to implement GUI to improve its appearance and make it more interesting.  
* This game involves two players in their respective boats, who will race to the end of the river using a dice roll.  
* This game was developed using Java, and the GUI libraries used were JavaFx and Swing.  
* All illustrations were designed using Adobe Illustrator.
